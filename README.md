### Glad to see you here!  
I‘m currently a Master's student in Artificial Intelligence (AI) at HKUST(GZ), with research interests in AI Agents. I am deeply interested in cutting-edge technologies and applications in the field of AI. I actively participate in data science competitions, accumulating experience and achievements in relevant fields. 

Looking forward to exchanging ideas with you.
